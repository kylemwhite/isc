		 * case, all the standard velocitySupport','Velocity context variables provided by
		 * SmartClient Server are available to you.
		 * 
		 * There is also one additional Velocity context variable available in this specific case: 
		 * $masterId. If there is a DataSourceField.foreignKey','foreignKey from the 
		 * DataSource for the current operation to another DataSource for which an add or update 
		 * operation has taken place earlier in the queue, this is the value of the target field of 
		 * the foreign key, taken from the response data of that earlier operation (the most recent 
		 * one, if there are several). This is useful because it will typically yield the (possibly 
		 * just generated) primary key of the "master" record.
		 * 
		 * Consider a queued batch of "add" operations for an order header and its details. The 
		 * detail additions need to know the unique primary key that was assigned to the order, but 
		 * this will typically be generated at the time of inserting the order row into the database,
		 * so it is not known up-front. However, this value will be in the response to the DSRequest
		 * that added the order header, so it is accessible via $responseData; if there is a 
		 * declared foreign key relationship from the detail DataSource to the header DataSource, the 
		 * header's unique key value will also be accesible as $masterId. See this example: 
		 * queuedAdd.
		 * 
		 * $responseData - which is an instance of 
		 * com.isomorphic.velocity.ResponseDataHandler - exposes various overloads of
		 * first() and last() APIs that can be called to obtain the actual 
		 * record data of prior responses. These methods return an instance of 
		 * com.isomorphic.velocity.ResponseDataWrapper, which allows convenient handling
		 * of response data whether it is a single record or a list. Response data can be treated as
		 * a single record even if it is a List, so you can access the response data directly, with no
		 * need for an index; when you do this, and the data is actually a List or array, you get the 
		 * first record. If the response data is a list or array, you can also access individual 
		 * records in that list using Velocity index notation, and you can use the special value 
		 * "last" to access the last element of a List or array.
		 * 
		 * Examples of the Velocity syntax needed:
		 * 
		 * $responseData.first.myField is the myField property of the first response in
		 * the queue. Note, this works whether that response returned a single record or a list. If it
		 * returned a list, this Velocity expression gets the first record in the list. This is a
		 * particularly useful shorthand for 'add' and 'update' operations, where the response data 
		 * is typically a List containing a single record
		 * 
		 * $responseData.first('order').myField is the myField property of the first response to an 
		 * operation (any operation) on the "order" DataSource
		 * 
		 * $responseData.first('order', 'add').myField is the myField property of the first 
		 * response to an "add" operation on the "order" DataSource
		 * 
		 * $responseData.first('order', 'fetch').last.myField
		 * is the myField property of the last record in the response data of the first fetch in the 
		 * queue (fetch operations always return a List of records)
		 * 
		 * $responseData.first('order', 'fetch')[0].myField is the myField property of a
		 * specific record (in this case, the first) in the response data of the first response in the 
		 * queue. Note that this is shown for completeness only: there is no need to use index 
		 * notation to explicitly request the first record, unless you are iterating over the entire 
		 * list or have some other out-of-the-ordinary use case. The first record is assumed if you 
		 * omit the index notation, so this example is equivalent to the simpler: 
		 * $responseData.first('order', 'fetch')[0].myField
		 * 
		 * All of these syntactic variations are also available on the $responseData.last object - 
		 * "last" here meaning the most recent response matching the DataSource and operation type (if 
		 * applicable). Note, "last" potentially has three different meanings, depending on context:
		 * If your DataSource contains a field that is actually called "last", the following expression 
		 * would be the correct way to obtain the value of the field called "last", on the last record
		 * of the last (most recent) response:
		 * $responseData.last.last.last
		 *

		 * com.isomorphic.velocity.ResponseDataHandler class.

	 * After a ListGrid is created and has loaded data, records may be accessed via
	 * ListGrid.data, for example, listGrid.data.get(0) retrieves the first record.
	 * ListGridRecords are also passed to many events, such as

		 * 
		 * Unlike the similar use of PickList.optionDataSource for PickList','pickLists
		 * used during editing or filtering, listGridField.optionDataSource causes the
		 * entire set of records from the optionDataSource to be fetched, without paging.
		 * Hence listGridField.optionDataSource is appropriate only for smaller valueMaps. For very
		 * large valueMap situations, such as an accountId field that should be displayed as an
		 * accountName where there are thousands of accounts, the correct approach is:
		 * 
		 * do not set listGridField.optionDataSource
		 * declare two fields in the DataSource, eg "accountId" and "accountName".
		 * Set the ListGridField.displayField attribute on the data field to the
		 * name of the display field.
		 * When fetching records for display in a grid, have your server send back values for
		 * both fields, but show only the data field ("accountId") in the grid.
		 * 
		 * In this case the cells in the accountId field will show the record value from the
		 * accountName field. This approach means the valueMap will never be loaded in its
		 * entirety, instead, each loaded record contains the valueMapping for that one record, as
		 * a pair of fields within the record.
		 * 
		 * If you are using the SmartClient Server Framework with the SQL or JPA/Hibernate built-in
		 * connectors, this entire approach can be achieved very easily using the
		 * DataSourceField.includeFrom setting - see the
		 * DataSourceField.includeFrom','docs for includeFrom for details.
		 * 
		 * Notes:
		 * 
		 * When using the above approach, it is key that the server return both
		 * the underlying stored value and the display value, as suggested above.
		 * This approach allows the PickList.optionDataSource property to be used to
		 * provide paged valueMaps during inline editing and
		 * ListGrid.showFilterEditor','inline filtering. This can be achieved by setting the
		 * optionDataSource attribute on the form item used to edit the field
		 * via ListGridField.editorProperties (for editing) or
		 * ListGridField.filterEditorProperties','field.filterEditorProperties (for
		 * filtering), without specifying an optionDataSource at the listGridField level.
		 * Alternatively developers can use ListGridField.autoFetchDisplayMap to
		 * suppress the fetch against the optionDataSource at the listGrid level.
		 * Setting listGridField.optionDataSource to the same dataSource as the
		 * listGrid is not the same as omitting the optionDataSource setting entirely. Unless
		 * ListGridField.autoFetchDisplayMap has been set to explicitly disable fetching,
		 * a fetch will be performed against the dataSource to build a valueMap which will be used
		 * as the definitive mapping from data to display values, rather than picking up the display
		 * values from the records themselves. This distinction is required to support cases where
		 * the ListGridField.valueField points to a different field in the grid (useful for
		 * hierarchical relationships, for example), or where ListGridField.optionCriteria or
		 * ListGridField.optionOperationId are specified and return different data from
		 * the records displayed within the grid.
		 * If a displayField is specified, with no associated optionDataSource, and the field is
		 * editable, updating the edit value for the field may not automatically update the displayField
		 * edit value, meaning the user may not realize the edit value has been modified.
		 * If the new value came from the user editing the field, and the edit item has
		 * a valueMap or optionDataSource specified, the display value is picked up automatically and
		 * stored out on the displayField for the record. However if the value was set programmatically,
		 * the developer should also set the edit value for the display field to ensure the displayed
		 * value reflects the new edit value. Note that when this occurs, a warning will be logged
		 * which can be disabled via ListGrid.warnOnUnmappedValueFieldChange.
		 * For very advanced usage a developer can use ListGridField.displayValueFromRecord

	/**
	 * AdvancedCriteria is a format for representing search criteria which may include
	 * operators on field values such as "less than", or may include sub-clauses such as several 
	 * criteria applied to fields joined by an "OR" operator.
	 * 
	 * SmartClient DataSources can use AdvancedCriteria to search a list of Records, and
	 * the SmartClient Java Server can translate AdvancedCriteria to either SQL or Hibernate
	 * queries (Note: The server-side AdvancedCriteria handling feature is only available 
	 * with the Power and Enterprise Editions of SmartClient; the Pro Edition is 
	 * limited to ordinary criteria handling on the server side).
	 * If the entire dataset is cached locally, SmartClient can perform AdvancedCriteria filtering 
	 * on the client, avoiding a server call.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * An AdvancedCriteria is an ordinary JavaScript object which can be created directly
	 * with JavaScript literal notation. For example:
	 * 
	 * var advancedCriteria = {
	 * _constructor:"AdvancedCriteria",
	 * operator:"and",
	 * criteria:[
	 * // this is a Criterion
	 * { fieldName:"salary", operator:"lessThan", value:80000 },
	 * { operator:"or", criteria:[
	 * { fieldName:"title", operator:"iContains", value:"Manager" },
	 * { fieldName:"reports", operator:"notNull" }
	 * ] 
	 * },
	 * { fieldName:"startDate", operator:"greaterThan", value:new Date(1388552400000) }
	 * ]
	 * }
	 * 
	 * This makes AdvancedCriteria very easy to store and retrieve as JSON strings, using
	 * JSON.encode','JSONEncoder.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 
	 * AdvancedCriteria can also be specified in componentXML','Component XML:
	 * 
	 * &lt;AdvancedCriteria operator="and" _constructor="AdvancedCriteria"&gt;
	 * &lt;criteria&gt;
	 * &lt;Criterion fieldName="salary" operator="lessThan"&gt;
	 * &lt;value xsi:type="xsd:float"&gt;80000&lt;/value&gt;
	 * &lt;/Criterion&gt;
	 * &lt;Criterion operator="or"&gt;
	 * &lt;criteria&gt;
	 * &lt;Criterion fieldName="title" operator="iContains"&gt;
	 * &lt;value xsi:type="xsd:text"&gt;Manager&lt;/value&gt;
	 * &lt;/Criterion&gt;
	 * &lt;Criterion fieldName="reports" operator="notNull"/&gt;
	 * &lt;/criteria&gt;
	 * &lt;/Criterion&gt;
	 * &lt;Criterion fieldName="startDate" operator="greaterThan"&gt;
	 * &lt;value xsi:type="xsd:datetime"&gt;2014-01-01T05:00:00.000&lt;/value&gt;
	 * &lt;/Criterion&gt;
	 * &lt;/criteria&gt;
	 * &lt;/AdvancedCriteria&gt;
	 * 
	 * An AdvancedCriteria is in effect a Criterion that has been marked with 
	 * _constructor:"AdvancedCriteria" to mark it as complete criteria.
	 * 
	 * In addition to directly creating an AdvancedCriteria object as described above, the
	 * DataSource.convertCriteria and DataSource.combineCriteria methods
	 * may be used to create and modify criteria based on simple fieldName / value mappings.
	 * 
	 * When passed to the SmartClient Server, a server-side AdvancedCriteria instance (in the
	 * package com.isomorphic.criteria) can be retrieved from a DSRequest via
	 * com.isomorphic.datasource.DSRequest.getAdvancedCriteria(). These same AdvancedCriteria
	 * objects can be directly created server side, and applied to a DSRequest via
	 * setAdvancedCriteria().
	 * 
	 * RestDataSource, the recommended way of integration with servers that are not running
	 * the SmartClient Server Framework, defines a standard XML and JSON serialization of
	 * AdvancedCriteria. Date, DateTime and Time values use the same XML Schema
	 * representation used for other XML serialization like RestDataSource. Further details can
	 * be found at dateFormatAndStorage.
	 * 
	 * It's a best practice for XML representation to have &lt;value&gt; as a subelement
	 * with xsi:type. Although most systems will auto-convert criteria explicitly
	 * setting type leaves the least room for error or ambiguity.
	 * 
	 * For other servers, you can translate AdvancedCriteria into whatever format is
	 * expected by the server, typically by implementing DataSource.transformRequest.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * See criteriaEditing','Criteria Editing for information about
	 * editing AdvancedCriteria in a DynamicForm.
	 * 
	 * When using the SmartClient Server, AdvancedCriteria created on the client and stored 
	 * as JSON can be used directly by server code (without involvement of the browser and client-side system).
	 * Use the server-side API AdvancedCriteria.decodeClientCriteria() to obtain an AdvancedCriteria that can 
	 * then be used with a server-created DSRequest object. Note that the client must be serialized by the 
	 * JSONEncoder class, using JSONEncoder.dateFormat "logicalDateConstructor".
