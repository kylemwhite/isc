The following types were excluded
1. boolean: Cannot declare a type with the same name as a JavaScript primitive
2. DSCallback: Defined as a type and also as a Callbacks method. Using the Callbacks method because it is more descriptive.

The following classes were excluded
1. VisualBuilder: This is an internal only class - do not try to use it directly in your applications.
2. SelectionOutline: NOTE: This class is for internal use only by EditContext.

The following attributes were excluded
1. attr:Process.setState: Hard-coded list: Process.setState is an attribute AND a method
2. dataGradients: Hard-coded list: [Map Gradient] is not a valid type

The following methods were excluded
=== Getter method return type does not match attribute type ===
1. method:SectionStack.getSections

=== Setter method param type does not match attribute type ===

=== From a hard-coded list ====
14. toShortTime: [Datetime] is not a valid type
15. toTime: [Datetime] is not a valid type
16. addProperties: Because A rest parameter must be of an array type
17. setState: Process.setState is an attribute AND a method
